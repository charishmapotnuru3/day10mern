*what is while loop?why we use it?
-->A while loop is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
   Ex:
         x = 0
        while x < 5:
            print(x)
             x += 1
  -While loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true, facilitating iterative tasks and dynamic program flow control.


*what is function?why we use functions?
-->A function in Python is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task when called upon, aiding in code organization and facilitating code reuse and modularity.
   ex: 
           def greet(name):
             return f"Hello, {name}!"
-Functions in Python help modularize code by encapsulating specific tasks or operations, promoting reusability, readability, and maintainability of code.


*what is function keyword?how to specify it?
-->In Python, the "def" keyword is used to define a function. To specify it, you start with the "def" keyword followed by the function name and its parameters,
   if any, enclosed within parentheses. For example:
    ex:
       def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):
               ---------
               ---------


*how to write multiple varibles in single line?
-->In Python, you can assign multiple variables in a single line by separating them with commas. 
   For example:
           a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
    This assigns the values `1`, `2`, and `3` to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively, all in a single line.

*what are the parameters to give for mapping method?
-->The `eval()` function in Python takes a single parameter, which is a string representing a valid Python expression or statement.
   This string will be evaluated as Python code, and the result of the evaluation will be returned.

*what are positional and keyword arguments?
-->In Python, when calling a function, arguments can be passed in two ways: positional arguments and keyword arguments.

   1. Positional Arguments: These are arguments passed to a function in the order they are defined in the function's parameter list.
                            Their positions (order) are crucial, as each argument is matched to its corresponding parameter based on its position.

      Example:
              def greet(name, location):
                print(f"hello{name}")
                print(f"your{age}")
           
            greet("maha",20)
  2. Keyword Arguments:These are arguments passed to a function with explicit parameter names. Their positions don't matter as long as they are correctly matched with their corresponding parameter names.

    Example:
         def greet(name, age):
            print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
       greet(age=20, name="maha")  # The order is different, but arguments are matched by their parameter names
